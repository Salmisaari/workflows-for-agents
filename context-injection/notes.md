# Context Injection

What the harness puts in front of the model on each turn.

## Four injection sources
- **Prompts** — system prompt, task framing
- **Memory** — recalled long-term entries, summaries of prior turns
- **Skills** — skill metadata (names + descriptions of available skills)
- **Conversation** — message history (or its compacted summary)

## Open questions to resolve in next pass

- Where does **tool schema** sit — context injection or tools layer? (Probably context: the model needs to *see* tools to decide to call them.)
- Where does **environment context** (cwd, env vars, git state, time) sit?
- Distinction between **always-on injection** (system prompt) vs **just-in-time injection** (skill bodies loaded only when invoked) — Claude Code's progressive disclosure pattern.
- Token budget allocation across the four sources — when context is tight, what gets cut first?

## Carries forward from existing SKILL.md

Existing skill says: "Each step gets exactly the context it needs. Not the full history — a summary of what came before, plus the raw input it must act on."

That's a workflow-level rule. The harness-level version is: **every injection is a deliberate budget choice.** Stale context is worse than no context.

## Pre-hydration

A pattern from production agents: when the user references an entity (a supplier, a customer, a SKU), don't make the model fetch it via tool calls. Hydrate it once at the start of the turn, inject it into the prompt as a structured profile, and let the model read.

```
User: "what's going on with Acme this month?"
        │
        ▼
[runtime extracts entity: supplier="acme"]
        │
        ▼
[runtime fetches profile, KPIs, recent threads — in parallel]
        │
        ▼
[injects ENTITY_PROFILE block into system message]
        │
        ▼
Model sees full hydrated context on turn 1, no tool calls needed
```

Why this beats letting the model fetch:
- **Latency.** One parallel fetch beats N sequential tool calls.
- **Token efficiency.** Pre-hydrated structured data is denser than tool-result sprawl.
- **Reliability.** The model can't forget to look something up.
- **Composability.** Hydration logic is deterministic and testable.

The cost: the runtime must know *which entity to hydrate* before the model runs. Use a cheap extraction step (regex, classifier, or small-model call) to identify the entity, then hydrate, then call the main model.

This is one concrete shape of the **resolver** idea (see `../resolvers/notes.md`): the harness decides what context the model needs and front-loads it.
